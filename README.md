# Detecting-Fake-News-with-Python
This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, built a TfidfVectorizer on the dataset. Then, initialised a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix reveals how well the model fares.

## Dateset
The 'news.csv' dataset has a shape of 7796Ã—4. The first column identifies the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE. The dataset takes up 29.2MB of space.


## Summary
Detected fake news in Python Jupyter NoteBook. Took a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. Ended up obtaining an accuracy of 92.5% in magnitude for the model.
